# morse.code
A Simple Morse Code App for Android

Made in HTML/CSS/JS with via webview. (I'm sorry)

## Legal Note:
This software is free. You can do whatever you want with it. You can print it, eat it, throw it at your friends or burn it. I don’t care. It’s yours to do whatever you want with it.

There is one catch: No warranty.

That’s right, if your workstation blows up during installation, that’s on you. If you break your collarbone trying to use the UI, that’s all your fault. I am not responsible for your nuclear detonations or any limbs lost.
